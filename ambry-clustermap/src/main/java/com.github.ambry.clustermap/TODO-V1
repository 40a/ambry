For initial clustermap:
TODO: Get code format / style from Ram so we have same automagic code formatting
TODO: Move helper methods to utils (after re-based with master)
TODO: Fix './gradlew build' which is broken by MessageFormat currently.
TODO: Fix SLF4J issue ("Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder") upon build.
TODO: Run with test coverage to assess how much more testing is required.

For hardening & clean up
TODO: might make sense to have an abstract class called JsonStringifier that has a protected JsonObject and a toString
      method implemented. All your class can then extend from this to get this functionality for free.
TODO: Add version number and/or timestamp to hardwareLayout and partitionLayout?
TODO: More unit tests
TODO: More logging

For V1
TODO: Document JSON format once V1 is mostly stable.
